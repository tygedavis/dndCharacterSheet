This is a web app designed to give the same feel as a paper character sheet from the popular role-play game Dungeons and Dragons.

Most online Dungeons and Dragons character sheets try to do all the heavy lifting for you. This takes away a lot of the charm that comes with Dungeons and Dragons.

This character sheet is specifically make to let you customize it however you (within your DM's permission, of course) would like.

### Math isn't Fun

This Dungeons and Dragons character sheet also allows you to have all the fun of role-play without having to take time out of your game to roll dice.

Don't worry, if you prefer a traditional dice rolling experience you can continue to play the game exactly as you would.

But if all these numbers in your head takes away from the magic of Dungeons and Dragons then you'll enjoy our automatic dice roller.

This feature will automatically roll your dice and add all of your added bonuses so that you can spend more time killing dragons and less time doing math.

Don't worry, this app still tells you if you rolled a nat 20 or a devastating nat 1.
