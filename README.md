This is a web app designed to give the same feel as a paper character sheet from the popular role-play game [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/).

Most online solutions for Dungeons and Dragons character sheets try to do all the heavy lifting for you. This approach takes away a lot of the charm that comes with Dungeons and Dragons.

Dragons Infinity is a practical solution for bringing your character online. It was built for players, by players.

The problem that we encountered frequently during our sessions of DnD was that while we loved the convenience of having an online character, the solutions that were available to players simply didn't allow the freedom, flexibility, or creativity that often results in unique situations developed by individual parties.

The solution that we came up with to this problem was to build a online software that near perfectly resembled using a sheet of paper. This would take away a lot of the convenience that these other solutions had but would encourage players to instead rely on the books.



### Math isn't Fun

This Dungeons and Dragons character sheet also allows you to have all the fun of role-play without having to take time out of your game to roll dice.

Don't worry, if you prefer a traditional dice rolling experience you can continue to play the game exactly as you would.

But if all these numbers in your head takes away from the magic of Dungeons and Dragons then you'll enjoy our automatic dice roller.

This feature will automatically roll your dice and add all of your added bonuses so that you can spend more time killing dragons and less time doing math.

Don't worry, this app still tells you if you rolled a nat 20 or a devastating nat 1.
